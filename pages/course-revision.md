Every year between Oct 15 and Nov 15, course descriptions must be reviewed and may be revised for the next study year. For each course, this should be done by the course coordinator for the next study year. Who that should be is the responsibility of the department's leadergroup and should be decided by Oct 15.

:tip:
A course description shall be a resource for students, teachers, study program leaders at NTNU, but also for potential applicants and others.


:tip:
Once approved and published on the external web, a course description is legally binding. That is, the actual course content, organization and evaluation must be in-line with the description.


## Reviewing and revising a course description

A course description consists of: the course title, the course content, the learning outcomes, the examination arrangement, incl. compulsory activities and grading rule, the recommend background, the pre-requisites and other admission requirements, etc. What is not part of the course description is the course schedule data and the registration of course schedule data is a separate [process](timeplan). 

All parts of a course description must be reviewed and it is possible to revise all parts, but changes must be justified and anchored, typically in the [course report](https://innsida.ntnu.no/studiekvalitetsportalen/) as a result of the evaluation of the course. The department and study programme(s) are important dialogue partners to ensure that the changes that are proposed comply with associated courses and programmes. Major changes in the course content might make it necessary to create a new course and are normally the result of a more comprehensive process at the department or study programme level, for instance as the result of a periodic evaluation of a programme.

Once a course description has been reviewed and all the changes, if any, have been registered, the course must sent to quality check (S2).
