Compulsory activities are assignments and/or tests that must be approved as a prerequisite for the right to assessment, but whose results are not included in the calculation of the grade.
Compulsory activities, if any, are listed in the course description. If compulsory activities have not been approved, the student must be informed within a reasonable period before the assessment.


## Approving compulsory activities

For each student registered for a course and each compulsory activity, the course coordinator must registered whether it is approved or not. 
Once the registration is completed, the course must notify the administration (see Contact below).

* **Deadline to approve compulsory activities:**
    - Within 14 days before the date of the exam, if any and otherwise within 14 days between the last submission deadline in the course
* **System:**
    - [Fagpersonweb](https://fsweb.no/fagpersonweb/login.jsf?inst=fsntnu) 
* **How-to:** 
    - [User guide](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/FS+-+Registrere+obligatorisk+aktivitet+i+Fagpersonweb) (in Norwegian only)
    
    
## What happens after the administration has been notified? 

Once notified, the administration finalizes the registration and notifies the students who have activities that have not been approved ([user guide for the administration](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/FS+-+Registrere+obligatorisk+aktivitet), in Norwegian only).
