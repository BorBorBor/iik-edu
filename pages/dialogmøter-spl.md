# Dialog Meetings

As study program leader, dialog meetings are the main mechanism to get information from the students about the learning environment. The agenda is usually structured by years, so that each KTV reports about feedback that they have received from other students in their cohort.

Of course, you can also use the opportunity to ask any questions to students.

* Frequency: 3 timers per semester
* Participants: SPL, KTV student of each cohort
* Duration: Usually around 45 minutes


## Tips

* Have an overview of the course plan of your study program, so that you know which are the most common courses that the students have. (In the early years, these are the compulsory courses.)
* Often, students focus on details in courses. In many cases, issues with courses should be discussed in the reference group meeting of that course. This gives the course reponsible a direct possibility to get feedback from the students and apply corrections.
* If you have the impression that an issue is not handled properly within the reference group, you can contact the course responsible directly. You may also ask to join the next reference group meeting. If this does not resolve issues or you are unsure, escalate the issue to the deputy department head for education.
* Create notes for the meeting that you can refer to in the next meeting.

Based on the impressions on the meeting you can forward issues to IIK Education, bring them into the study program council, and include them into your quality report for the study program so that they eventually influence the action plan for the study program or the department.
