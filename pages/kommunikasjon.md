# Communication with Students



## Blackboard Announcements

Use Blackboard announcements for all information related to the organization of the course like deliverables, deadlines, information about new material, schedule or rooms. 


## Piazza

Piazza is an online forum that is quite user friendly and popular among many students. IIK has a license for all its courses, and we enable Piazza for all IIK courses at the beginning of the semester.
Piazza will then be available from the menu in Blackboard.

The main function of Piazza is asking questions that you, assistants or peer students can answer. In some courses we have registered more than 500 posts in a semester.

The use of Piazza for students is voluntary, which means that any information that all students should receive necessary information as always as Blackboard announcements. Piazza should only be used to answer additional questions asked by students.


Have a look below for a tutorial how to use Piazza in your course. Thanks to Mattia teaching in Colins course TTM4195.

:tipsbox:
* Introduce Piazza in your course explicitly, and tell students to ask questions there instead of via for instance email.
* Add a task in the lecture where students should post a question on Piazza, just for getting into the habit. In this first round, these can be fun questions.

q: Why does IIK use Piazza?
---
We have identified missing feedback from students as one important issue to improve across all courses at the department, and decided therefore to use Piazza.

q: Why did you select Piazza and not X?

NTNU has integrated Piazza in Blackboard, and it was the best forum solution we are aware of.
