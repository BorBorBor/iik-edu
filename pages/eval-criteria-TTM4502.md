q: C – Describle the motivation for the assignment.
---
The student·s shall explicitly provide a motivation for the assignment. The motivation of the assignment should discuss how the research project (1) relates and contributes to solve or address societal challenges, and / or (2) contributes to advance the research field by providing new knowledge or refine methodologies. The motivation of the assignment should be qualitatively discussed by the student·s. The student·s should provide references to other sources that support the motivation for the assignment.

q: D – Describe the state of the art / research front in the field.
---
The project must be placed into the context of current knowledge and practice. A limited literature survey should be included, featuring prominent research both in the general area and in research closely related to the project. The most important unsolved problems in the related areas should be identified and an explanation provided of how the planned work will contribute to addressing one or more of those problems. Relevant literature should be cited appropriately. The reference list must be consistently formatted with a focus on peer-reviewed literature but supplemented by web and proprietary documentation as necessary.

q: E – Formulate the specific objective·s / research question·s / hypothesis·es for the master's thesis.
---
The project must have clearly defined objectives, aimed to address some well-defined specific research questions related to the motivation. The objectives should be clearly stated in the report. A good research question should be feasible, interesting, novel, ethical and relevant (FINER). In addition to the motivation, the research questions should also be driven by the hypotheses. The research questions and hypotheses should be developed before or at the start of the work and guide the research objectives throughout the work.

type: qna
q: F – Describe a proposed method to achieve the objective·s and, if relevant, verify the result.
---
The student·s must demonstrate that it is understood what a method is.  One definition in this context can be is *a particular systematic established procedure for approaching the objectives*. The nature of the research wuestions must be defined. Research questions can be related to a traditional science or a design science context or combinations. Traditional science is related to models of systems in the real world, while design science is related to the modeling and also validation of human created artifacts. Research tasks and method must be defined related to research questions. Research questions can be related to various research tasks. Examples of research tasks are: constructive design, traffic modeling, behavior simulations, traffic simulations, measurements, validation of design and traffic models verification. Methods are related to the nature of the research tasks. The research method specifies in more detail how the research tasks are accomplished.

q: G – Become familiar with and test the tools that are planned to be used in the work.
---
By the end of the pre-project, the student·s must clearly present an assessment of the tools expected to be used in the thesis. These tools may include software, hardware, theoretical frameworks or a combination of any of them. The mandatory assessment shall include a reasoning behind the choice of each tool, referring to the required functionalities and how they can be exploited to address specific issues in the thesis. For each tool the student·s shall perform an initial hands-on evaluation, confirming with mock experiments that expectations are met and necessary resources are accounted for. The student·s should also include details of existing documentation, development communities, as well as known drawbacks/disadvantages when compared against known alternatives.

q: H – Prepare an initial plan for the work towards the master's thesis including description of sub-tasks, progress, resource utilization and milestones.
---
The work during the thesis project should be divided into a reasonable number of tasks (~ 5) adapted to the project. If not obvious, there should be a brief motivation for the subdivision into tasks. The task objective, technical approach and expected outcome should be specified together with start and end dates and resource utilization (working hours, lab usage, tools, etc). Milestones should be put at reasonably regular intervals (~ average 3rd week, at end of tasks) where specific intermediate results should be ready. Milestones should enable tracking of the progress of the work. Dependencies between tasks and if relevant external input, should be identified. Visual support, e.g., as a Gantt diagram, is a pre. Potential risks should be identified and if significant, means to deal with them should be outlined.
