## Reference Group Meetings


During the semester, there should be three reference group meetings. Usually, the course responsible will invite you to the meetings. If this does not happen, feel free to remind them.




## Before the Meeting

* Have a dialog with the other students in the class about their experiences of the learning environment, course material and learning activities. 
* Read the reference group report of the last iteration of the course, and the course report written by the instructor. You find these reports in the [Studiekvalitetsportalen](https://innsida.ntnu.no/studiekvalitetsportalen/).


## During the Meeting

* For each reference group meeting, create a short document that summarizes the main content of the meeting. 
These will help you once you create the final report.
* Agree on the date for the next reference group meeting.


## After the Last Meeting

* Write the final reference group report, and submit it in Teams.
* You can receive a proof of your participation in the reference group.
