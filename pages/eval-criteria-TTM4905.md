### Scientific and technological challenge and results

- **Challenge**: Are the task application of know methods on a standard class of problems, or are any of these new? Have similar tasks been dealt with before? What are the requirements for abstraction and innovation? A simple task shall never be given a top grading.
- **Substance of the results**: Is something implemented and working? Are simulations carried out and/or analytical results obtained? Has the student produced a specific, unambiguous design or is a thorough trade-off between alternatives based on sound criteria performed? It should be taken into account that working towards concrete results may require time to get equipment, software, etc. configured and up and running.
- **Broadness**: What are the requirements for maturity and overview of the field? How broad is the issues addressed and what is its scientific/technical/disciplinary span?

### Significance and originality

- **Novelty**: Does the work give new facts, ideas or insights? Are there innovative elements? 
- **Relation to the state-of-the-art**: Has the candidate shown sufficient insight into and overview over the problem domain? Does the manuscript include representative references to other work within the domain? Is the candidate able to put his/her own work into a wider context and the work of others? The references and bibliography are important in this context.
- **Utility**: Is the work practical or theoretical useful? With respect to this criteria, be aware that it is the relevance of the work with respect to the formulation of the task that is evaluated, not the relevance of the (given) task itself.
- **Autonomy**: What has the candidate achieved by him/herself from the given task/problem? To get a proper evaluation, the evaluator must be informed about how the problem formulation has evolved though the work and the support given to the student.

### Methodological quality

- **Method**: Is any method used in the work and (if relevant) is there an explicit choice of method? Are suitable formalisms
chosen and used?
- **Methodological reliability**: Are the methods used and the investigations done sufficient to support the conclusions?
- **Logical consistency**: Are there contradictions in the report? Do the observations support the conclusions? Are there alternative interpretations of the observations? Is the basis for the conclusions (e.g. the observations) complete?
- **Procedural quality**: Is the working procedure well-documented and is any quality assurance with respect to the work/results carried out? When the task is to develop a (software) system, the SW quality (wide sense; documentation included) should be taken into account.

### Presentation

- **Structure**: Is the report written in a manner that makes it easy for the reader to get an overview over starting point/objectives, what is done and the conclusions/results, and to maintain this overview throughout the reading. Does the report contain the necessary elements as abstract/summary, table of contents, introduction, etc.
- **Clarity**: Is it easy/possible/difficult/impossible to follow and understand what is written? Are proper references given to from where information is obtained? Are the references in the list complete?
- **Information density**: Is the relation between content and volume satisfactory? How long is it between the “golden nuggets”? Are information about details unnecessary for progression of the reading put into appendixes?
- **Style**: Does the candidate make a distinction between essentials and details? Is the work boring to read? Is there an overview chapter/section (cf. structure) which makes the work more available?
- **Illustrations and tables**: Are illustrations and tables clear, reasonably “self contained” and informative? Is there a duplication between text and illustrations/tables. Could some of the text be better presented/conveyed in the form of illustrations or tables?
