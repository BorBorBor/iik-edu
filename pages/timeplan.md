# Course scheduling (for course coordinators)

:warning:
*Current deadline: **Aug 25, 2023** – Registration of course schedule data for courses to be given spring 2024.*


Once it is decided that a course is to be given a given semester, the course coordinator has two tasks:
- register course schedule data the semester before the course is given, and
- control the tentative timetable for the course once a draft is available.

See [https://ntnu-timeplanprosessen.webflow.io/](https://ntnu-timeplanprosessen.webflow.io/) for a presentation of the entire course scheduling process at NTNU.


## Registering course schedule data

Course schedule data is information about what kind of teaching a course will have, the duration of each activity, who is expected to attend the activities (students and staff), and possibly demands and wishes for certain equipment and/or room specifications. 

* **Deadline to register course schedule data:**
    - 5 workdays before the deadline for the Department, which is March 1st and September 1st for courses to be given in the autumn and in the spring, respectively.
* **System:**
    - [TP: Basic data](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/grunnlagsdata/) 
* **How-to:** 
    - [User guide](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/TP+-+Brukerveiledning+for+innmelding+av+timeplandata) (only in Norwegian)

## Controlling the tentative timetable for the course

The course coordinator should check that:
- all the activities that should be scheduled are indeed scheduled, that
- all the activities are planned according to what you registered in [TP: Basic data](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/grunnlagsdata/), that
- for each activity, the type of activity and staff is correct and, if any, that the allocated room is suitable, that
- the activities are both scheduled the weeks they will occur and not scheduled the weeks they will not occur, and finally
- if you are teaching in more than one courses, that teaching times are not colliding.

Problems/errors should be reported to the Department's administration, see Contact below.

Information about a specific room, incl. the available equipment, is available in [TP]https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/timeplan/?type=room. 

* **Deadline:**
    - June and November for courses to be given in the autumn and in the spring, respectively. The actual dates depend on the deadline set by the central administration.
* **System:**
    - [TP](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/timeplan/emner.php?lang=en) (select the relevant semester in the drop-down menu on the right and search for the course by course code.)
