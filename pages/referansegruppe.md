# Reference Groups

:checklistbox: 
* Reference groups are mandatory for all courses at IIK.
* At least three students in the group.
* At least three meetings per semester.
* **Create groups** and **deliver the reference group report** in [Kasper](https://studntnu.sharepoint.com/sites/studieplanlegging).


At IIK, **all courses must have a reference group**. This includes all teaching activities that have a course code, that means, also specialization courses and courses for the preparation of project, bachelor and master theses.


# Creating Reference Groups

A reference group must consist of at least three students, but often more students (for instance up to six) make the discussion richer, and easier to assure that at least three students can meet for the reference group meetings.
The members should be representative of the students in the course, with respect to aspects like gender, study program, or exchange status.

The course responsible creates a Teams for the reference group in [Kasper](https://studntnu.sharepoint.com/sites/studieplanlegging).

q: What should I do if there are only few students in the course?

If your course has only few students, declare the entire course to be the reference group and have reference group meeting with all students.

q: What if no students volunteer for the reference group?

* Explain how you have worked with reference groups earlier and how that lead to specific improvements in the course.
* In higher classes, mention that if students want to use you as a reference in their CV, this would be a way for you to getting to know them (if relevant).
* Contact the KTV student of the cohort to motivate some of the students in class.
* Contact or the SPL of the study program.



:tipsbox:
* Establish the reference group already during the first week of lectures.
* Announce that you want to form a reference group beforehand on Blackboard, and ask for volunteers to signal their interest to you.



# Information to Students

Inform students about the [tasks of a reference group](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/referansegruppe+-+kvalitetssikring+av+utdanning), or show them the following video.

# Reference Group Meetings

The reference group should meet at least three times during the semester. The first meeting should be early in the semester, to detect any misunderstandings or problems with the course setup as early as possible.

:tipsbox:
* Focus of the meetings should be on the learning environment in the course. Don't ask too much in the direction _"How do you like the course?"_, but _"What did you learn?"_ and _"How can you learn better?"_
* Tell students that you are interested in constructive feedback, and how valuable such feedback is for you. 
* Inform students that they should write minutes for each reference group meeting as a preparation for the final reference group report.
* If you are teach a course with a colleague, make sure they join the reference group meeting. If you teach alone, invite a colleague into the meeting. This can help reflecting on the student feedback.
* Consider to which degree you want to involve learning assistants in the reference group meetings.


# Reference Group Report

The reference group writes a final report using the template in the Teams for reference groups.
You must submit this report using the functionality in the created Teams. 

# Proof of participation

Students participating in the reference group receive a proof of experience when the semester is over.
