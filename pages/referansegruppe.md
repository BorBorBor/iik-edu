# Reference Groups

At IIK, **all courses must have a reference group**. This includes all teaching activities that have a course code, that means, also specialization courses and courses for the preparation of project, bachelor and master theses.

A reference group must consist of at least three students, but often more students (for instance up to six) make the discussion richer, and easier to assure that at least three students can meet for the reference group meetings. The members should be representative of the students in the course, with respect to aspects like gender, study program, or exchange status.

A reference group should meet at least three times, and the last meeting should be after the assessment results are published.

Tips:

* Establish the reference group already during the first week of lectures.
* Announce that you want to form a reference group beforehand on Blackboard, and ask for volunteers to signal their interest to you.
* If your course has very few students, declare the entire course to be the reference group and have reference group meeting with all students.
* If no students volunteer for the reference group:
    * In higher classes, mention that if students want to use you as a reference in their CV, this would be a way for you to getting to know them (if relevant).
    * Contact with the KTV student of the cohort to motivate some of the students in class.
    * Contact or the SPL of the study program. 

Follow these simple steps to create the reference group in KASPER. 

## Proof of participation
Students participating in the reference group receive a proof of experience when the semester is over. The template below is already signed by the Dean of the IE Faculty, and should be signed by you before you hand it over to the students.
