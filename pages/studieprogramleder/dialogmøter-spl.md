# Dialog Meetings

:checklistbox:
* **Frequency:** 3 times per semester
* **Participants:** SPL, the [KTV students of each cohort](../student/studentrepresentanter.html)
* **Duration:** Usually around 45 minutes


As study program leader, dialog meetings are the main mechanism to get information from the students about the learning environment. The agenda is usually structured by years, so that each [KTV](../student/studentrepresentanter.html) reports about feedback that they have received from other students in their cohort. Of course, you can also use the opportunity to ask any questions to students.


## During the Dialog Meeting
:tipsbox:
* Have an overview of the course plan of your study program, so that you know which are the most common courses that the students have. (In the early years, these are the compulsory courses.)
* Often, students focus on details in courses. In many cases, issues with courses should be discussed in the reference group meeting of that course. This gives the course responsible a direct possibility to get feedback from the students and apply corrections.
* If you have the impression that an issue is not handled properly within the reference group, you can contact the course responsible directly. You may also ask to join the next reference group meeting. If this does not resolve issues or you are unsure, escalate the issue to the deputy department head for education.
* Create notes for the meeting that you can refer to in the next meeting.


## Follow-Ups

Depending on the discussion items, you can follow up in the following ways:

* Contact relevant course responsibles.
* Contact the cohort coordinator.
* Contact your study program council leader.
* Contact the deputy department head for education.

On a long term, the dialog meetings inform your awareness of the quality of the learning environment in the study program and influence your planned action, feedback in the quality report and the study program plan.
